Step 3: Create Your Page

This is where the fun begins! You'll create your own page in the app folder.
Understanding Next.js App Router

In Next.js 13+, pages are created in the app folder using the file-based routing system:

    app/page.jsx = Homepage (/)
    app/ananya/page.jsx = Ananya's page (/ananya)
    app/yourname/page.jsx = Your page (/yourname)

Creating Your Page

Create a new folder in the app directory with your name:

mkdir app/yourname

Create a page.jsx file inside your folder:

touch app/yourname/page.jsx

    Add your page content (see sample code below)

Step 4: Add Your Card to the Homepage

Edit app/page.jsx and add your card to the community members section.
Step 5: Submit Your Changes

git add .
git commit -m "Add my awesome page to XUNITE!"
git push origin main
